# Hapapot Website


The site uses
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) as a server framework
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a database


## Installation

node should be installed

run:
```bash
npm install
```
in the root directory


## Run

before starting the server a url of a MongoDB instance should be configured in the config/database.json file, after that run the following command in the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```
the script should start the server on port 8080
and a react development server on port 3000 with the express server as proxy
